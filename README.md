## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### 1. Clone and Install the Project

First, clone and install the `nvchad` configuration framework:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nvchad/starter ~/.config/nvim
```

Then, navigate to the `~/.config/nvim/lua` directory, delete the existing configuration, and clone the `nvcustom` configuration:

```bash
cd ~/.config/nvim/lua
rm -rf *
git clone https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git .
```

### 2. Choose a Theme Branch 🎨

During installation, you can choose a different theme based on your preference. The project supports three theme branches: `main` (default theme), `light` (light theme), and `dark` (dark theme). You can choose and clone a branch using the following commands:

- **Default Theme (main)**:

  ```bash
  git clone -b main https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git .
  ```

- **Light Theme (light)**:

  ```bash
  git clone -b light https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git .
  ```

- **Dark Theme (dark)**:

  ```bash
  git clone -b dark https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git .
  ```

Once done, start Neovim to load the corresponding theme configuration.
