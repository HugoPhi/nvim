# nvcustom - Neovim Configuration Based on NvChad üé®

[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README_zh.md)

This is my Neovim configuration on [dotfile](https://dotfyle.com/HugoPhi/nvim), primarily focused on aesthetics and power, so there may be some performance issues. Please bear with me.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Clone and Install the Project, and Choose the Theme Branch üé®

During installation, you can choose different themes according to your preferences. The project supports three theme branches: `main` (default theme), `light` (light theme), and `dark` (dark theme). The dark theme is suitable for 23-inch displays, while the light theme is mainly for smaller laptop screens. You can choose and clone different branches using the following commands:

- **Default Theme (main)**:

  ```bash
  git clone -b main https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git ~/.config/nvim
  ```

- **Light Theme (light)**:

  ```bash
  git clone -b light https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git ~/.config/nvim
  ```

- **Dark Theme (dark)**:

  ```bash
  git clone -b dark https://github.com/hugophi/nvcustom.git ~/.config/nvim
  ```

After cloning, launch Neovim to load the corresponding theme configuration. It may take a little longer the first time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

## üöÄ Usage

1. After installing and configuring nvcustom, simply launch Neovim to start using it.
2. All core features are enabled by default and optimized according to best practices.

## ‚ú® Customization

- To customize features or change settings, refer to the [NvChad documentation](https://nvchad.com/) and the documentation of the related plugins.
- Each feature module is configured independently, so you can adjust the configuration files in the `config` directory according to your needs.
